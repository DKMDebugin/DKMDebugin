### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

At present, I am pursuing a master's in software engineering with data analytics at the University of Limerick, Ireland. I am a member of the PySlackers community which is an inclusive community for Python programmers. I am also a member of the MDN Web Docs community where I contribute to making an outstanding resource for developers who use the open web technologies. In addition, I contribute to open source projects such as Flask.
